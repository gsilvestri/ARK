/**  SUBFORMS
*
* describe the subforms and the vars they need to display properly
*
* 1 - set up any validation rules you need in the vd_settings file
*
* 2 - set up any fields to put into the form. generally these go into 
*  the field_settings file as this means they can be used by other modules
*
* 3 - add in any custom validation
*
* 4 - set up the form using the standard subform format. The form is an array
*  containing variables that define the form using an array of fields
*
*
* VARIABLES FOR SUBFORMS:
* Mandatory:
* view_state = the default view state (min or max)
* edit_state = the default edit state (edit or entry or view)
* sf_nav_type = how to display the navigation in the subform (full, name or none) 
* sf_title = this is the nickname of markup to display in the title bar of the sf
* sf_html_id = the form id tag (must be unique)
* script = the script to use on this subform
*
* Optional:
* op_label = the label for the options row of the form usually 'save' or 'space' (markup nname)
* op_input = the label to appear in the button (markup nname)
* op_register_mod = embedded registers need this
* op_subform_style = embedded registers need this set TRUE to display like an sf
* op_xmi_mod = the xmi viewer needs this to know which module to display
* op_modtype = TRUE = using different fields for each modtype, FALSE = using one fields list for all different modtypes.
* op_lightbox = using lightbox in this subform (TRUE/FALSE)
* Spans: 
* op_fancylabels = fancy labels for a span or not (off or on)
* op_fancylabel_dir = direction of the span (topdown or centric)
* op_spantype = name of the spantype (table: cor_lut_spantype, field: spantype)

*
* Fields:
* The fields array is a collection of fields that display in the subform.
* 'fields' => array($field1, $field2)
* If using modtypes for this module you can have one fields array for each modtype.
* For 2 modtypes with different fields, enable op_modtype with TRUE:
* 'type1_fields' => array($field1, $field2),
* 'type2_fields' => array($field2, $field3)
* If using modtypes with one fields list disable or leave out op_modtype 
* and use the plain fields list.
